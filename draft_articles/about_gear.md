# Gear and Practices for Making Mead

Here is a list of gear you may need to get started on making mead, along with some notes on their usage:

## Carboys

-   Glass carboys are great for secondary fermentation due to their ability to keep oxygen out.
-   When using plastic carboys, be sure to leave enough headspace to prevent air from entering the carboy during fermentation.
- started in glass carboy… the typical question „too much headspace?“ #todo yes! Go bucket…

## Buckets

-   Buckets are useful for primary fermentation, and headspace doesn't really matter at this stage.
-   Rack into something else after fermentation is done
- scale initially about 10%+ of what your appropriate glass vessel can hold

## Hydrometers

-   A hydrometer is used to measure the specific gravity of your mead, which is used to calculate alcohol content.
-   #todo Scalings, SG, Brix, Oechsle, abv? Which hydrometers are wrong (spirit hydros) #todo warn about spirit hydrometers - range for beer vs wine hydrometers - minimum 1.120 better 1.150
-   Plastic no-break hydrometers…

## Refractometers

-   Refractometers are useful for measuring the sugar content in your must, but cannot be used during fermentation. #todo describe adjustment how to use (links)

## Vinometers

-   This is a Germany-specific tool that is not very useful for making mead #todo when it would work (dry mead) and else not… abv when measuring with sugar present always wrong - how a hydrometer reading is needed anyhow

## pH Measuring

-   Test strips
-   Digital pH meters and calibration

## Measuring Cylinders

-   A measuring cylinder is useful for accurately measuring and pouring liquids.
-   #todo sizes - as small as the hydrometer works in…

## Autosiphons and or Racking Canes

-   Autosiphons or racking canes are useful for transferring mead between containers. Be sure to choose the appropriate size for your containers. #todo note about some not fitting into carboys - using racking cane with silicone tubing and clamp as alternative 

## Bungs

-   Bungs are used to seal carboys or other containers during fermentation. Be sure to choose the appropriate size for your container. #todo mazerial of bungs - bungs that push out and what to do

## Airlocks

-   S shaped
-   2 piece
-   3 piece

## Stir plates

-   Flasks to use for starters
-   Stir bars

## Bottling Wands

-   Bottling wands make bottling your mead much easier and more efficient.
-   Can be attached to buckets with spigots or directly to autosiphons
-   Plastic made or stainless steel (warn about reduced flow)
-   Hints on how to fill bottles fully to avoid way too much ullage

## Marbles (no!)

-   Marbles should not be used in mead-making as they can harbor bacteria and contaminate your mead.
-   #todo what to use instead

## Gear to use for flavoring Ingredients

-   Brew bags, muslin bags, teabags, nut milk bags, hop socks, and hop spiders can be used to add various flavoring ingredients to your mead.

## Corkers

-   Standcorkers are preferred over handcorkers for corking wine bottles.
-   Size restrictions on bottles (italian vs portuguese)
- dry run with empty bottles and ised corks to evaluate perfect fit

## Sub-gram Scale

-   A sub-gram scale is useful for measuring small amounts of ingredients accurately.

## Thermometers
- Food thermometer at the start for making sure the yeast won't die
- Min/Max thermometer to know your brew room

## Heating mats
- if it gets cold in your brew room...

### Additives (maybe leave out as not gear)

-   Additives such as sanitizers, oxyclean, potassium sulfite, potassium sorbate, pectic enzyme, tannins, acid additions, and potassium carbonate can be used to modify your mead.
- alternatives to StarSan (clones, sulftites+citric acid), ... what about bleach or iodine...

### Fining Agents (maybe leave out as not gear)

Fining agents are used to clarify mead by removing suspended particles and sediment. These agents work by attaching to the particles, forming clumps, and settling to the bottom of the container. There are different types of fining agents that work through different mechanisms, such as electrical charge or chemical reactions.

Some common fining agents and their electric charge include:

-   Bentonite: negatively charged
-   Gelatin: positively charged
-   Isinglass: negatively charged
-   Chitosan: positively charged

Choosing the right fining agent depends on the type of particles that need to be removed and the desired clarity of the mead. Some fining agents may be more effective than others for certain types of particles. It's important to carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions when using fining agents to avoid over-fining or leaving behind residues. After adding fining agents, it's recommended to give the mead some time to settle before transferring it to a new container or bottling.

In addition to the fining agents mentioned earlier, there are a few other options available, such as kieselsol, Super-Kleer KC, and Sparkalloid. Kieselsol is a negatively charged fining agent that works well with positively charged fining agents like chitosan. Super-Kleer KC and Sparkalloid are examples of combo products that contain both positively and negatively charged fining agents. These fining agents work by attracting oppositely charged particles, causing them to form clumps that settle to the bottom of the container, making it easier to separate the clear mead from the sediment.

One important thing to note is that these fining agents need to be mixed into the mead thoroughly to work effectively. After adding the fining agent, it's recommended to gently stir the mead once or twice a day for a few days to ensure the particles are evenly distributed throughout the mead. This helps the fining agent come into contact with all the particles in the mead, increasing its effectiveness. After a few days, the mead can be left to settle, and the clear mead can be racked off the sediment.

## Taking samples
- wine thieves
- wine thieves that can hold hydrometers
- turkey basters
- giant syringes

## Bottles

-   Wine bottles, corking, and flip tops can all be used to bottle your mead. The choice of bottle can also affect the aging process of your mead.
-   Note on bulk aging in carboys
- Swing tops, seal replacements...
- Bottles with tasting corks...
- Cork sizes...
- beer bottles with crown caps

### Oaking maybe not gear? Leave out if already good documentation exists

-   Chips, cubes, staves, and spirals can be used to add oak flavor to your mead. The amount of time you leave the oak in your mead will affect the final flavor.
-   Oaking is the process of adding oak flavor to mead. There are several ways to do this, including using oak chips, cubes, staves, or spirals. The amount of time that the mead is in contact with the oak will affect the flavor and intensity of the oak flavor. Generally, oak should be added during the secondary fermentation stage, although some mead makers prefer to add it during primary fermentation.
-   Different types of oak impart different flavors, and oaks from different regions can also have unique characteristics. The toasting level of the oak can also impact the flavor profile. Lightly toasted oak will give a more subtle flavor, while heavily toasted oak will give a stronger, smokier flavor. Medium toast is a popular choice for mead makers, as it provides a good balance of flavor and aroma.

The recommended contact time for different types of oak varies depending on the desired flavor profile and the surface area of the oak. Here are some general guidelines:

-   Oak chips: 2-6 weeks
-   Oak cubes: 2-3 months
-   Oak staves: 3-6 months
-   Oak spirals: 2-6 months

It's important to note that these times are just recommendations, and the actual time needed may vary depending on the strength of the oak and the desired level of oakiness. It's a good idea to periodically taste the mead during the oaking process to determine when it has reached the desired level of oak flavor. Also, keep in mind that oak can quickly become overpowering, so it's best to err on the side of caution and start with a shorter oaking time, and add more oak if needed. Additionally, the toast level of the oak can also affect the flavor profile, with lighter toast providing a more subtle oak flavor and heavier toast providing a more pronounced oak flavor.
