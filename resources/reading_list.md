### Note to Editors and Readers

This is not an exhaustive list. To create and maintain such a list would violate the wiki guideline against highly fluid information. These resources should be either cornerstones of mead making or offer distinct and valuable information.

Provide all possible information, including a link for electronic resources. Links are discouraged for physical books.

There are *many* more resources on the subject of making mead. Feel free to ask for recommendations on the subreddit and in chat; use the search function and Google.
