Welcome to r/mead,

Whether you are an experienced meadmaker or just starting here are a few tips to help:

1) Please be kind on r/mead. People are here to learn and to help others make better mead and to share their passion about mead. 

2) Please read the wiki, a lot of general questions are answered there and it is a useful source of information. - http://www.reddit.com/r/mead/wiki 

3) If you have not already it is recommended that you purchase a hydrometer as it will be highly useful in helping people to assist you with any question or issues you are having.

4) Please be clear and detailed when posting a question, the more information you provide the easier it will be to help you and the more accurate the response you will receive.

5) If you want to just share a picture of your mead please be sure to post a description or ideally the recipe.  People love to talk about what we are making. 

6)  For more knowledgeable people remember - We all started somewhere and while it may sometimes feel like you are answering the same question 100 times, really you are answering the question for 100 different people. What may seem basic to you is something you needed to learn about at some point.

7) Mind the bots.

Thanks, 

The r/mead mod team
