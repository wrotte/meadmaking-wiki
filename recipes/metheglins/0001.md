Hops, Czech Saaz | 2 oz | Bag to allow easy removal from boil.

**Additional Notes:**

Also consider similar recipes with hibiscus. More reading on detailed process notes is available[ here](/process/process_summary). Consider dry hopping, adding more cinnamon, or ginger all in secondary to taste, after examining acid/sugar/tannin balance after some aging.
