###Sparkling Hydromel

(by /u/balathustrius)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Semi-Sweet Sparking Traditional

**Carbonation:** 2.5 volumes

**Target Original Gravity:** 1.060

**Target Final Gravity:** 1.012

**Ingredients**

Ingredient| Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Honey | 10.5 lbs | 8.5 lbs for fermentation, 2 pounds for backsweetening, use a good honey (tupelo, orange blossom, meadowfoam, fireweed)
GoFerm PE | 14.4 g |
Fermaid O | 8.5 g |
Fermaid K | 9.0 g | 
Potassium Metabisulfite | 1.0 g † |
Potassium Sorbate | 3.75 g ‡ |
SafAle US-05 | 11.5 g (dry yeast package) | [Rehydrate in the Go Ferm using 290 ml water at 110 F](http://www.scottlab.com/product-102.aspx)

**Method:**

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE. I follow GoFerm's instructions on the temperature instead of what's on the package, but you could probably do either.

1. Aerate twice daily until the gravity reaches 1.040.

1. After the lag phase, when there is evidence fermentation has begun, add the Fermaid O. Add the Fermaid K split into two additions at 48 and 72 hours after adding the Fermaid O.

1. Ferment at 62-65° F.

1. Rack as desired.

1. Fine or filter if desired. Otherwise, wait until it's very clear.

1. Stabilize with potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate.

1. Backsweeten with 2 lbs of honey.

1. Allow any newly-introduced haze to settle out.

1. Siphon into CO2 flushed keg and force carbonate to 2.5 volumes. You can crank it to 3.0 if you like.

1. Serve chilled.

**Additional Notes:**

This mead can be ready to drink in 2-3 months.

† This is enough K-Meta for any finished mead up to a pH of about 3.4. [Enology @ UMN.edu](http://enology.umn.edu/2011/03/10/sulfur-dioxide-as-an-antimicrobial/)

‡ This is enough K-Sorbate for an ABV of up to 10%, assuming a pH of less than 3.5. [Peynaud (1984)](http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Making-Wine-Alan-Spencer/dp/047188149X), [Enology @ UMN.edu](http://enology.umn.edu/2011/02/23/potassium-sorbate-as-a-wine-preservative/)
