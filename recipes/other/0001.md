###Bochet

(by /u/StormBeforeDawn)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Mead with caramelized honey.

**Carbonation:** Still

**Target Original Gravity:** 1.129

**Target Final Gravity:** 1.000 - 1.012

**Ingredients**

Ingredient| Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Honey | 18 lbs | Wildflower 
Oak| 2 Spirals | Med toast American oak. May use cube or chips at preference.
Goferm PE | 12.0 g
Fermaid O | 8.5 g |
Fermaid K | 9.0 g | 
DAP |16.0 g|
Lavin 1118 | 10 g (dry yeast package) | [Rehydrate in the Go Ferm using 290 ml water at 110 F](http://www.scottlab.com/product-102.aspx)

**Method:**

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE.

1. In a pot or brew kettle at least three times the volume of honey boil honey for 1-2 hours, until desired caramelize is achieved. See notes. 

1. Allow to cool to under 200F or 90C before adding 1 gallon of hot water. Stir till homogeneous, reheating may help, and briefly boiling honey water mixture is acceptable.

1. After 24 hours add the 1/3rd of the nutrients, then the next at 48 hours, and the last at the 1/3rd sugar break. 

1. Ferment at 62-65Â° F.

1. Stabilize and backsweeten as desired, non-toasted honey can make for a complex backsweetening choice. 

1. Rack off lees after 1 month and add oak spirals, aging on oak as desired. 

1. Bulk age or bottle and store for 12 months.

**Additional Notes:**

See /u/Jewish_Monk 's image for bochet color. "70-80" is a good place to start, but do not be afraid to go darker. https://i.imgur.com/mxK85Tf.jpg
Cook time depends on many factors. Shoot for a specific color. The darker you go the longer you must age.
Ice bath may help cool times on honey. Mixing boiling honey and water will risk hospitalization. You have been warned.
