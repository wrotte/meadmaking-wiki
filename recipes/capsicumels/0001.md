(by /u/balathustrius)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Spicy Capsicumel

**Carbonation:** None

**Target Original Gravity:** 1.110

**Target Final Gravity:** 1.000 - 1.030

**Ingredients**

Ingredient| Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Mesquite Honey| 15 lb |
Water | Enough to reach 5 gallons total volume | Should be roughly 3.75 gallons.
Cleaned Jalapeños, seeds and pith removed | 15 oz | 
Cleaned Cayenne, seeds and pith removed | 5 oz |
(optional) Cleaned Habaneros, seeds and pith removed | ? | Completely optional. Adjust heat with these.
Fermaid O | 8.5 g |
Fermaid K | 8.5 g | 
DAP | 5.5 g | 
D-47 | 10 g | Alternatively, Red Star Pasteur Champagne

**Method:**

1. Halve peppers. Clean by removing pith and seeds. Wear latex/nitrile gloves.

1. Smoke for 2 hours at 200°F, or until they begin to get crispy.

1. Add Fermaid O post-lag. Split DAP and Fermaid K into 3 additions (1.83 g DAP x3, 2.83 g Fermaid K x3) at 24 hour intervals.

1. Ferment at 62°F.

1. Use 3 ounces of fresh French oak cubes for 4-8 weeks.

1. Allow at least 6 months of aging (including time on oak), but it's better in 12 months.

Stabilize and backsweeten as desired, or leave bone dry.

**Additional Notes:**

If this is left dry, approach it like a bourbon. Pour a finger into a rocks glass and sip.

If sweetened to near-dessert levels, it will be a little more approachable for normal drinking - but still hot.

Capsaicin levels in hot peppers naturally vary. If you want more heat, you can add habaneros to taste, two at a time for 2 weeks at a time, until the desired heat has been reached.

Try this as a marinade or as a replacement for red wine in a barbecue sauce.
