### Standard Cyser

(by /u/StormBeforeDawn)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Dry Cyser
**Carbonation:** None

**Target Original Gravity:** 1.107

**Target Final Gravity:** 0.995 - 1.000 

**Ingredients**

Ingredient| Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Honey | 9 lbs | 
Apple Cider | 4.25 gallons | Fresh pressed, preservative free. 
GoFerm PE | 12.5 g |
Fermaid O | 8.5 g |
Fermaid K | 9.5 g | 
DAP | 2.7 g | 
QA23 | 10 g | [Rehydrate in the Go Ferm using 250 ml water at 110 F](http://www.scottlab.com/product-102.aspx)

**Method:**

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE.

1. Confirm OG of must, tweak as needed for target ABV. QA23 is a 16% yeast. 

1. Aerate twice daily until the gravity reaches 1.071.

1. After 24 hours add the 1/3rd of the nutrients, then the next at 48 hours, and the last at the 1/3rd sugar break. 

1. Ferment at 62-65Â° F.

1. Rack as desired.

1. Stabilize and backsweeten as desired, or leave dry.

1. Fine or filter if desired. Otherwise, wait until it's very clear.

1. Allow at least 6 months of aging, but it's better in 12 months.


**Additional Notes:**

This is a versatile base recipe. Spices could be added in secondary, backsweetening after stabilizing is an option, as is carbonation. 

Usually you buy cider by the gallon. Since this batch is scaled for 5 gallons, you may want to use all of the juice and a touch more honey if you have a large primary vessel. Just keep the OG the same, nutrition will be close enough.
