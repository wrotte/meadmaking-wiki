## How do I use the L.D. Carlson "Energizer" and "Nutrient" additives?

It's very straightforward. You go with the instructions on the package for L.D. Carlson Nutrient and Energizer.

L.D. Carlson is not open about what their nutrient additive products contain, or even about nitrogen content, which makes good experimentation and quantification nearly impossible.

&gt;If I were I making an educated guesstimate, provided that we're talking about a **five gallon batch** I'd guess this:

&gt;1 tsp of L.D. Carlson Nutrient adds ~40 PPM YAN. I guess this because it’s marked as containing DAP with Urea, so we can assume it’s similar to DAP, which comes in at roughly 40 PPM YAN at this dose.

&gt;1 tsp of L.D. Carlson Energizer adds ~20 PPM YAN. I guess this because it contains dead yeast hulls, magnesium sulphate, and DAP. This is similar to (but simpler than) Fermaid K’s composition. Fermaid K comes in at roughly 20 PPM YAN at this dose.

&gt;You probably want to add enough nutrient that you reach at least 200-300 PPM YAN.

&gt;L.D. Carlson's instructions indicate 1 tsp Nutrient per gallon and 1/2 tsp Energizer per gallon. For five gallons, that comes out to (5 tsp * 40 PPM YAN) + (2.5 tsp * 20 PPM YAN) = 250 PPM YAN.

&gt;So like the package says: 5 tsp Nutrient and 2.5 tsp Energizer [for a 5 gallon batch].

&gt;But, know that you're getting most of your nitrogen content [(70%-80%)](http://i.imgur.com/4Lic7Tp.png) from DAP. Meadmakers have learned over the years that it isn't the most time-efficient way to go about making drinkable mead.
