Please read the following and compare what you are seeing to them.   

*Common items that are typically not mold and no reason to panic:*

     1) Small white dots on the surface of your mead.

     2) Lees or sediment on the bottom of your mead.

     3) Clumps of yeast cells floating around.

     4) Small white dots in the neck of your carboy or fermenter (you likely just dumped the yeast in dry).

*Items that may be mold:*

     1) Green or black clumps floating on the surface of the mead.

     2) A white pellicle covering the entire surface of your mead or looks like spiderwebs on top of your mead.

     3) Long snot like strands in the mead.
