## Where do I find yeast? What type should I use?

Some mead makers find one yeast that works for them and stick with that. Many enjoy trying different strains to explore unique esters and discover niche applications. 

### I don't even know where to start. Just tell me what to use.

Here are a few nearly-foolproof yeast strains.

**Lalvin 71B-1122**

* Alcohol Tolerance: 14%

* Temperature Range: 59-86°F.  Ferment in the low 60s to low 70s.

* Low nutrient requirements. 

**Red Star Pasteur Blanc** (Previously known as "Pasteur Champagne")

* Alcohol Tolerance: 13-15%

* Temperature Range: 59-86°F. Ferment in the low 60s to low 70s.

* Very clean fermenter.

**Lalvin EC-1118**

* Alcohol Tolerance: 18+%

* Temperature Range: 59-86°F. Ferment in the low 60s to low 70s.

* Very aggressive.

### Where to Buy

Most local homebrew shops carry common wine and beer yeasts. Online shops have a wider selection of yeasts that are not commonly found in homebrew stores. Bread yeast is, of course, available from the grocery store.

Be careful when buying from large retailers like Amazon, especially when purchasing liquid yeast - it may have been stored improperly or sat around long past its best-by date.
