# Water in Meadmaking

## Important Aspects of Water

Water makes up most of the volume of all alcoholic drinks and can be important as a flavor component.  Not the water, but the minerality.  Water naturally contains a number of ions in solution (which is normal) and they contribute to the 'profile' of it.  Water chemistry, for brewing purposes, is related to the basic mineral ion content of the water and ensuring it is free of other contaminants (to both health and/or flavor).

Use the best tasting water you have access to.  This may be your tap water or it could be purchasing spring water your grocery store.  The overall cost of several gallons of water is only a small portion of the cost of the honey used in the same recipe.  Spring water is preferred over RO/distilled water, for reasons specified below.

### Minimum Recommended Treatments

* Carbon filtration
OR
* Sulfite/campdens

Carbon will remove a variety of impurities unnecessary and potentially harmful to fermentation.  It is generally recommended and better for your health if you use municipal water for drink.  A main element to remove or is chlorine and chloramines.  They can react to form some medicinal off-flavors.

Alternatively, 1 campden tablet or 0.38g of sulfite powder will treat 20gal/75L of water for chlorination.  The amount is a lot lower than stabilization and is not intended for anything other than treating to remove chlorine.  This method will work for chlorine but does not do as much as carbon would otherwise.

Brita-style filter work although relatively cheap under-sink water filters are easier and work a lot faster and better than handheld brita pitchers.  They transform nasty tap work into very drinkable water straight from the faucet without waiting or noticing anything else.

## Using Low Mineral Water (RO/Distilled)

Reverse Osmosis or distilled (or deionized water) is water that is devoid of minerals.  This can affect the taste and make the mead 'thinner' or less robust tasting.  It can also affect aspects of fermentation as the minerals found in normal water is part of the yeast's health and controls various aspects of their functions (for example, calcium ions and flocculation).

### Water Profile Recipes

Here is some 'recipes' to recreate the major mineral profthe new geniles for various commercial waters available.  More will be added over time.

All are listed in the required water salt in grams per gallon or liter.
