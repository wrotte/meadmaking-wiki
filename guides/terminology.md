## Terminology

This page is designed to explain terms and also bridge hobbies.  Some terms are interchangeable between brew hobbies and some are not.

### General Fermentation Terms

**Bottle Bomb** - A bottle that has too much CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure and has ruptured.

**Bottle Conditioning** - The act of carbonating a brew in a sealed bottle with live yeast and priming sugar.

**Nutrients/Nutes** - Bio-available nitrogen source for yeast amino acids.

**Pitch** - The addition of a live yeast culture to begin fermentation.

**Rack/Racking** - Transferring brew from one container to another, often to leave behind sediment/lees/etc.

**Water Chemistry** - Describes the composition (aka 'profile') of mineral salts present in water; most often used in beer but applicable to any brewing style.
 

### Mead Terms

#### Mead Styles

### Terms from Beer

**Attenuation** - The amount of wort sugars a type of yeast can ferment; typically expressed in percent.  NOTE: honey/mead musts are 100% fermentable.

**Lightstruck** - Describes hops that have been exposed to UV light; often develops off-flavors for nearly all styles.

**Wort** - The 'must' equivalent for beer; a pre-ferment composed of grains and often hops.

### Terms from Kombucha

**First fermentation** - A primary fermentation composed of sugar, tea, and water (and occasionally other ingredients).  It is unlike 'primary fermentation' since a portion of final first fermentation will be saved for the next batch.

**1F** - Shorthand for first fermentation.

**Second Fermentation** - A fermentation where flavorings, often fruit, are added to a completed 1F brew.  It is similar to a true 'secondary fermentation'.  Often used for bottle conditioning.

**2F** - Shorthand for second fermentation.
