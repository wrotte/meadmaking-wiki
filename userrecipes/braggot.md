**Target ABV:** 5.8%

**Target YAN:** 98 effective PPM

**Ingredients**

Ingredient| Amount | Notes
---|---|---
Honey | 3 lbs | 
Gold LME | 3 lbs | 
Elderflower | 1 lbs | Be careful about pesticides. Some flowers are not meant for consumption.
Heather	| 3 oz |

**Method:**

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE.

1. In a pot or brew kettle bring to boil LME and 2 gal water. 

1. Add hops and boil for 20 minutes. 

1. Turn off the heat, and add both herbs in two brewers bags.

1. Allow to rest 30 minutes, but keep temps above 150F if it cools too rapidly.

1. Pour boil into brew bucket, add 2 gallons cold water and honey and bentonite, mixing vigorously with a drill stir until dissolved. 

1. Follow SNA, dividing out nutrients in the first third of the ferment. 

1. Ferment at 62-65° F.

1. Rack off lees after no more than 1 month. 

1. Once the mead begins to clear, stabilize and backsweeten to taste and acid/tannin balance if needed.

1. Bulk age and force carbonate. If bottle carbing, see the wiki for carbonating naturally with unfermentable sugars to backsweeten, or decide if you like the mead dry.

**Method:**
1. 24 hours before ferment, process bananas with amylase and/or pectinase at your discretion. Omitting this will increase body which may be desirable.

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE.

1. In a pot or brew kettle bring to boil LME and 2 gal water. 

1. Add hops and boil for 60 minutes. 

1. Chill rapidly, if possible, adding honey when under 100F, if possible.

1. Rack boil into brew bucket, add 2 gallons cold water and honey, mixing vigorously with a drill stir until dissolved. Fill to 5 gallons.

1. Add bananas in brewers bag.

1. Follow SNA, dividing out nutrients in the first third of the ferment. 

1. Ferment at 65° F.

1. After you hit FG, add orange zest in a brewers bag. 

1. Rack off lees after no more than 1 month, removing bananas no more than 2 weeks post pitch. 

1. Once the mead begins to clear, stabilize and backsweeten to taste and acid/tannin balance if needed. Add orange juice if acid is needed. 

1. Bulk age and force carbonate. If bottle carbing, see the wiki for carbonating naturally with unfermentable sugars, or decide if you like the mead dry.

Notes: Consider aromatic hops near end of boil if you want more hop aroma and do not intend to bulk age too long. Otherwise, late dry hops mid bulk age could add a nice aroma.
