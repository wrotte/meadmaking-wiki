##Traditional

For user mead recipes that are honey forward. If there is oak or other minor adjuncts, they should support the honey, and not be immediately the dominate flavor.

**Method:**

Note: This is a staggered sugar addition mead. It's process is non-standard. 

1. Rehydrate the yeast using the GoFerm PE.

1. Add 1/3rd of primary honey, and bentonite. Stir vigorously to aerate. 

1. Ferment at 62-65Â° F.

1. After 24 hours, add 4.7g dap, 2.4g FermK, and aerate 2x daily.

1. After 48 hours, add 4.7g dap, 2.4g FermK, and aerate 2x daily.

1. After 72 hours, add 4.7g dap, 2.4g FermK, and aerate 2x daily.

1. After SG hits 1.050  add in 8 lbs more honey, remaining dap and FermK.

1. 24 hours after honey addition, add 5.6g FermO and aerate 1x daily.

1. 48 hours after honey addition, add 5.6g FermO and aerate 1x daily.

1. When SG hits 1.050, and remaining honey and remaining FermO.

1. Leave to ferment to FG and let rest a month. 

1. Rack off lees and add oak spirals, aging on oak as desired. 

1. Once the mead begins to clear, backsweeten to taste. Ideally you will need a few pounds to get you up to 1.020+, but it's dependant on how effective your staggered sugar and nutrition was at hitting 20%+ ABV and your personal preference.  

1. Bulk age or bottle and store for 12 months.

Notes: OG is theoretical due to staggered sugar. Target ABV is 20.5%. Drink like a port.
