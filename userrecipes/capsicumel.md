## Capsicumel

Anything goes so long as it's got some heat. From jalapenos to superhots.

### Reaper 2

(by /u/stormbeforedawn)

**Total Volume:** 1 gallon

**Style:** Capsicumel

**Carbonation:** Yes

**Starting Gravity:** 1.142

**Target Final Gravity:** 1.000

**Target ABV:** 18%

**Target YAN:** 336 effective PPM

Ingredient | Amount | Notes
----------|------|-----
Honey | 4 pounds
Carolina Reaper | 4 | Dried
habaneros| 5 | Dried
Red Chilies | 6 | Dried
Poblano | 1 | Fresh, halved.
Yeast | Lavin 1118
Med Toast American Oak | 1 Spiral |

1. Take honey and mix with warm water to form must. 

2. In a small pot simmer for 10 minutes all peppers while covered in 1/4 cup water. Add result to must, and get the peppers in a muslin bag. Do this with gloves. Do not get this mixture on your hands. 

3. Follow SNA, rehydrate yeast with goferm PE.

4. While the mead ferments, taste while aerating. Remove peppers when desired heat is achieved. 

4. After 1 month rack and add 1 medium toast oak spiral. 

9. Rack in 1 more month, or when clear.

10. Backsweeten to taste as needed. This is better a little sweet, but is very unique dry as well.  

**Additional Notes:**
This is hot, it burns more than a bit. For my most current recipes I step feed sugars to push 1118 past its limits, and have gotten as high at 21%, but the exact ABV for this style of mead isn't important. Serve chilled over ice and sip slowly, being careful not to inhale. 

The pepper mixture from the simmer releases a lot of capsaicin. Ventilate the area. The mixture is not harmful to your skin, but getting the mixture in your eyes or other membranes will ruin your day. The mixture does not wash off skin easily, even with soap. 

For hilarity, consider food dyes like butterfly pea blossom or similar. Naturally this mead is orange from the capsaicin.

### Mango Habanero 4

(by /u/stormbeforedawn)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Capsicumel, melomel

**Carbonation:** Yes

**Starting Gravity:** 1.144

**Final Gravity:** 1.000

**Target ABV:** 17%

**Target YAN:** 288 effective PPM

Ingredient | Amount | Notes
----------|------|-----
Honey | 20 pounds
Mangos | 10 | Peal and third, leaving pit in center third
Habaneros | 4 | whole and fresh, halved
Yeast | Lavin 1118
Med Toast American Oak | 1 Spiral |

1. Take honey and mix with warm water to form must. 

2. Add sliced mango and habs in separate bags to must, stir and fill to 5 gallons.

3. Follow SNA, rehydrate yeast.

4. Remove habs when desired heat is reached, and remove bagged fruit after 2 weeks.

4. After 1 month rack and add 1 medium toast oak spiral.

9. Rack to bulk age in 1 more month, or when clear.

10. Backsweeten to taste with honey.

11. Force carbonate and serve when the mead has aged.

**Additional Notes:**
Consider adding 10 more mangoes in secondary for more flavor, or reducing habaneros if a less spicy drink is desired. Heat is hard to remove. The fruit isn't measured on a hydrometer and the total volume should measure 5 gallons prior to fruit addition. This lowers the final ABV compared to the expected from the OG slightly.
