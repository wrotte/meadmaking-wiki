##Metheglin

For herb and spice forward meads. Nothing's wrong with a bit of fruit in here to supplement some strong anise. Floral and tea based meads go here too.

###Meadow Queen's Delight 

Meadowfoam with Queen-Anne's Lace, vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg

(by /u/new-Baltimoreon)

**Total Volume:** 5 gallons

**Style:** Metheglyn

**Carbonation:** no

**Starting Gravity:** 1.134

**Final Gravity:** 0.995-1.000

**Target ABV:** 17%

**Target YAN:** 317 effective PPM

Ingredient | Amount | Notes
----------|------|-----
Honey | 18.6 pounds |1Gal Meadowfoam, 1/2-Gal Queen-Anne's-Lace (QAL)
Lavin 71B | 10g | 2 packets
GoFerm PE | 12.5 g
Fermaid O | 8.5 g |
Fermaid K | 9.5 g | 
DAP | 17.5 g |
Green Cardamom |32.3g | whole
Vanilla Beans|10 small whole beans (about 20g)| split just before adding in Secondary
Ceylon Cinnamon|25.3g | whole quills
Nutmeg | 1 Whole Nut (6.2g) | ground just before adding




1. Warm honey containers slightly to get it to flow more easily, and then add all of the Meadowfoam, and half of the QAL to the Fermentation Vessel

2. Add about a half gallon of 110^o F water and mix vigorously to start dissolving honey (rinse empty honey containers, tools, and funnels with the warmed water)

3. Add additional room temperature water to about 4.5 gallons of total volume, continue stirring vigorously (I use a drill stirrer), take a sanity gravity check. 

4. Rehydrate Yeast according to directions (1/4 cup water per packet @ 105^o F, for 5-15 minutes)

5. Add remaining QAL honey, continue mixing, and add water to final gravity/volume of 1.134 / 5 gallons is reached. 

6. Pitch re-hydrated yeast and cap with Airlock

7. Add nutrients using SNA, aerating in the first third of the ferment.

8. Vigorous fermentation lasts about 2 weeks, rack in 3-4 weeks

9. Add all spices in Secondary, placed in small individual muslin "Hops" bags to facilitate easy removal.

10. Remove spices after 2-4 weeks (according to your personal taste), and let age in secondary until clear.  


**Additional Notes:** 

This recipe is intended to be served dry, but backsweetening is an option. As always, balance acid/sugar/tannin levels post ferment.

###Chai Cyser

(by /u/rowsdower44)

**Total Volume:** 1 gallon

**Style:** Fruit and Spice Mead

**Carbonation:** No

**Starting Gravity:** 1.125

**Target Final Gravity:** 1.000

**Target ABV:** 15.5%

**Target YAN:** 194 effective PPM


Ingredient | Amount | Notes
----------|------|-----
Clover Honey | 2 pounds
Apple Juice | 1 Gallon 
Pectic Enzyme| 1/2 tsp 
Yeast | Lalvin K1-V1116
Chai Spices | 1 TBSP |

1. Warm up half of the apple juice and add the honey to it in order to homogenize. 

2. Add must and remaining apple juice to carboy.  

3. Add pectic enzyme.

4. Follow SNA, rehydrate yeast.

5. After 1 month rack, and add 1 TBSP of chai spices and 2/5 lb of honey to backsweeten to semi-sweet.

6. Immediately add sorbate and campden in order to prevent any further fermentation. 

7. Let it sit until it is clear. Rack if necessary.  

**Additional Notes:**
For chai spices, I used a blend I bought at a spice store. To make your own, use 2 parts ginger and cinnamon, to 1 part cardamom, star anise, cloves, black peppercorns, and bay leaves.     
    
The spices will provide enough tannins to the mead so you will not need to include any extra.     
    
You may also add acid blend in order to balance out the final product.
